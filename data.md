**Cameras**   
The data was collected from street cameras hosted by Borealis Broadband which are setup in and around Anchorge. Most of these cameras capture new images as frequently as once every five minutes. This is very useful as it means 1) a large volume of data can be scraped 2) this high temporal resolution can provide a lot of useful information e.g. how pixel values change for images of a plowed street as it begins to snow.

The images from the cameras have a resolution of 960 X 1280 pixels, where each pixel is 3 bytes (1 byte per color channel).
