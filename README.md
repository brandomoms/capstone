# Road Condition Classification in Anchorage

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to use openly available imagery to automatically determine winter road conditions (clear pavement, slush, snow, etc.). Classification will be done using a Convolutional Neural Net trained on the image set.

Once the classifier is trained, an automated process will be created to regularly pull images from their source, run the classification, and update a map of Anchorage (to be added to this page) to display road conditions at various sites.
