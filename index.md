## Road Condition Classification in Anchorage

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to use openly available imagery to automatically determine winter road conditions (clear pavement, plowed, slush, snow, ice, etc.). Classification will be done using a Convolutional Neural Net trained on the image set. 

Once the classifier is trained, an automated process will be created to regularly pull images from their source, run the classification, and update a map of Anchorage (to be added to this page) to display road conditions at various sites. 

## Data
The data will come from street cameras hosted by Borealis Broadband, and will include images of the Potter's Marsh weigh station, at least three downtown sites, and at least one midtown site. Most of these cameras capture new images as frequently as once every five minutes. This is very useful as it means 1) a large volume of data can be scraped 2) this high temporal resolution can provide a lot of useful information e.g. how pixel values change for an image of a plowed street during a snow storm.
